## problem:
<h3>You have to write a program in which you will have to insert numbers in linkedlist but the trick is when we print that list no repeated element should be print also when if you want to delete any element that has repeated before, than firstly, you have to delete that repetited element.
</h3>
<h3>better understand by an example</h3>
<h2>firstly we enter some elements in linkedlist like: </h2><h2><b>1 2 3 4 5 </b></h2>
<h2>now when we add a number <b>2</b> in linkedlist ,, than also linkedlist must be look like same because 2 is repeated element ..so the final list will be like : </h2>
<h2><b>1 2 3 4 5 </b></h2>
<h3>now we delete an element <b>5</b> from this list .. so the final list will be look like : </h3>
<h2><b>1 2 3 4 </b></h2>
<h3>now we recieve an command of deletion of 2 ,,but in this case the 2 will not delete from the main list because 2 was came twice for insertion .. so the final list will be look like: </h3><h2><b>1 2 3 4 </b></h2>
<h3>And again we recieve a command for deletion 2,, now in this case 2 will be deleted as 2 came only two times and we already delete 2 once .. so the final list will be look like: </h3><h2><b>1 3 4 </b></h2>
<h3>And now when again if we receive a command of deletion of 2 ,,than it must be show "element dosent exist"</h3>
<h1>so I got this simple java solution for this..</h1>
